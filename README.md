MISAHUB- AutoWCEBleedGen Challenge

Presently, an experienced gastroenterologist takes approximately 2âˆ’3 hours to inspect the captured video of one-patient through a frame-by-frame analysis which is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human error. In view of the poor ratio of patient-to-doctor across globe, there arises a need for investigation and state-of-the-art development of robust, interpretable and generalized Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This will aid in reducing the burden on gastroenterologists and save their valuable time by computer-aided classification between bleeding and non-bleeding frames and further detection and segmentation of bleeding region in that frame.
